You can find our graduation project in the "emt2_bitirme" file. The ipynb file named "System code" contains the Python code in which we apply this system and get the output. This algorithm detects objects on the tray using a pre-trained YOLO model. Using the price information of the products in the "Price_list" file, it gives an output that tells how many products and the total amount. Detailed information is included in the graduation project.
